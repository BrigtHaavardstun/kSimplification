# Data file structure

The files holding the data will be as follows: 

Each row represents one ts. 
They will start with a single value, representing the class.
Then follows n floating point values, representing the y value for each time series, seperated by a single Tab. 

This will be the same as the UCR, and hence we should be able to use files from this archive directly.
